# README #

This repository is to develop a perl module to execute Donald Knuth's DLX algorithm for solving the exact cover problem. We will later use this to solve Sudoku, the n-queens problem, and graph decomposition problems.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Hopefully some people find this useful!
* This is currently a work in progress
* Eventually we will extend this to solving other problems.

### How do I get set up? ###

* For now, I have these looking at the local directory
* Eventually it'll be on CPAN and we can get it into @INC
* You can run tests for the solver with prove or yath
* Only the solver is tested at the moment. In the future, more unit testing will be required.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* All are welcome to contribute!... I just need to figure out how to set that up...

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Repo owner or admin
* Other community or team contact
